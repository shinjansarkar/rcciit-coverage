<!-- 
This is a placeholder for Google Search Console verification.
Once you add your site to Google Search Console, replace this content 
with the verification meta tag or HTML file they provide.

Example verification meta tag (add to index.html <head>):
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE" />

Or if using HTML file verification, rename this file to the name 
Google Search Console provides (e.g., google123abc.html) and 
put their verification content here.
